# Visilib Overview#

The visilib project aims to provide an efficient and robust library for exact visibility computation in 3D.

The main feature of the current version of Visilib is the exact visibility computation between two primitives (points, segments or polygons). The visibility computation is exact and make no simplification, in opposition to conservative or aggressive visibility methods: Visilib performs the complete penumbra fusion of the occluders, by the use of CSG operations in Pl√ºcker space.

The algorithm is described in detail in the technical paper "A Low Dimensional Framework for Exact Polygon-to-Polygon Occlusion Queries" (see "Paper" section).
However, the library has been completely rewritten and benefits from several improvements in comparison to the paper (see "Features" section).

Visilib is written in C++, it is cross-platform and distributed as a header only library.


### Features ###

- Available exact visibility query:
    - polygon to polygon
    - segment to segment
    - segment to polygon
    - point to point
    - point to segment
    - point to polygon
    
- robust arithmetic computation via exact artithmetic via CGAL and LEDA libraries  (multiple precision arithmetic combined with interval arithmetic computations)
- fast ray-triangle intersection based on Intel Embree library
- easy to deploy: header only library 

- Visibility performed via CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) operations in Plucker space:
     - Optimal minimum polytope building algorithm in Plucker space
     - Polytope splitting algorithm using only skeleton of polytopes (vertices and edges)
     - Silhouette optimization algortihm reducing drastically the number of CSG operations
     - Guided aperture sampling and early termination: rays are casted in the visibility apertures left by the previously processed occluders, leading to early termination in case of mutual visibility
     - Occluder selection using previous queries
     - Computational Geometry predicates in Plucker space

### Applications ###
- Potentially Visible Set computation (PVS)
- Sound propagation (edge diffraction)
- Shadow and lighting computation
- Robotic

### Cross-platform ###

- CMake: linux, windows

### Supported Compilers ###

- GCC // Add version
- Visual Studio 2019

### Dependencies ###
- CMake 3.14.0

### Optional dependencies ###
- CGAL and LEDA (exact arithmetic)
- Embree (fast ray-triangle intersection)
- Google Test (unit testing)
- Doxygen (documentation generation)

## #Unit tests ###

- based on Google test

### Visilib Extensions ###

Visilib will be extended in the future, in order to provide a complete framework for exact visibility determination in 3D. The following features will be added in the future:

 TODO 
 Full visibility determination (in addition to the boolean visible/hidden predicates) for exact form-factor computation and exact shadow computation
