# Visilib #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

The visilib project aims to provide an efficient and robust C++ library for exact visibility computation in 3D.

The main feature of the current version is exact occlusion query between two polygons, a polygon and a segment, or between two segments, and allows to answer the fundamental question "Are these two polygons mutually visible?". The principal application is from-region occlusion culling and exact Potentially Visible Set computation (PVS). The visibility determination is exact and make no simplification, in opposition to conservative or aggressive visibility methods: visilib performs the complete penumbra fusion of the occluders, by the mean of CSG operations in Pl√ºcker space. All the technical details are described in the companion paper "A Low Dimensional Framework for Exact Polygon-to-Polygon Occlusion Queries", presented at EGSR 2005 (cf. download section)

###Features###

- Available exact visibility query:
    - polygon to polygon
    - segment to segment
    - segment to polygon
    - point to point
    - point to segment
    - point to polygon
    
- robust arithmetic computation via exact artithmetic via CGAL and LEDA libraries  (multiple precision arithmetic combined with interval arithmetic computations)
- fast ray-triangle intersection based on Intel Embree library
- easy to deploy: header only library 
- fully documented (doxygen)

- Visibility performed via CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) operations in Plucker space:
     - Optimal minimum polytope building algorithm in Plucker space
     - Polytope splitting algorithm using only skeleton of polytopes (vertices and edges)
     - Silhouette optimization algortihm reducing drastically the number of CSG operations
     - Guided aperture sampling and early termination: rays are casted in the visibility apertures left by the previously processed occluders, leading to early termination in case of mutual visibility
     - Occluder selection using previous queries
     - Computational Geometry predicates in Plucker space

###Applications###
- Potentially Visible Set computation (PVS)
- Sound propagation (edge diffraction)
- Shadow and lighting computation
- Robotic

###Cross-platform###

- CMake: linux, windows

###Supported Compilers ###

- GCC // Add version
- Visual Studio 2019

###Dependencies###
- CMake 3.14.0

###Optional dependencies:###
- CGAL and LEDA (exact arithmetic)
- Embree (fast ray-triangle intersection)
- Google Test (unit testing)
- Doxygen (documentation generation)

###Unit tests###

- based on Google test

###Visilib Extensions###

Visilib will be extended in the future, in order to provide a complete framework for exact visibility determination in 3D. The following features will be added in the future:

 TODO 
 Full visibility determination (in addition to the boolean visible/hidden predicates) for exact form-factor computation and exact shadow computation
